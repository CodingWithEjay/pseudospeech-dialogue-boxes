# Pseudospeech Dialogue Boxes

## About

This is a GML object + script implementation of dialogue boxes with pseudospeech. This effect can be found in games like Undertale and all of the Animal Crossing titles.

## How it Works

```gml
// Initialize position and stringPrinted
position = 0;
stringPrinted = ""; 
```

## Example

This repository includes an example of the code that shows how to play with things like conditions. It also comes with a sound for the pseudospeech. However, since I developed this on a Mac, there's no .gmx unfortunately; you'll have to settle for a .gmk file.
